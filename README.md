# NYC CITI BIKE CHALLENGE

## Background:

Citi Bike, NYC's official bike share program, was designed to give residents and visitors a fun, affordable and convenient alternative to walking, taxis, buses and subways.
There are 800 Citi Bike stations and 13,000 bikes across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey City. Users can join as an Annual Member (Subscriber) or buy a Day Pass or 3-Day Pass (Customer), and can take as many rides as they want while their membership or pass is active.

The purpose of this project is to perform a bike trip analysis using data from Citi Bike. Visualizations created in Tableau would be presented to investors to convince them that a similar bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

## Results:

TRIP DURATION: The graphs show that most trip durations finish within the hour or less.
-A line graph displaying the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users.The graph can be filtered by the hour 
-There is a line graph displaying the number of bikes that are checked out by duration for each gender by the hour, and the graph can be filtered by the hour and gender

HEATMAPS: The heatmaps show that peak usage is during the commute hours (7am to 9am, 5 pm to 7pm) on weekdays. We can also infer that subscribers use the service on weekends as well.

- A heatmap showing the number of bike trips for each hour of each day of the week
- A heatmap showing the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week. The heatmap can be filtered by gender
- A heatmap is created showing the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week, and you can only filter by user and gender
